                <p>Thank you so much for so consistently showing up to sessions
                    and overall just being such a queen. You are SO smart (literally always getting the 
                    the problems we do and thank you for being so patient while I had to check my math too), and I can't wait to hear more
                    about all the other cool things you do in life (hmu for club info)! :)

                <p> Even from the first session, you've been a constant source of inspiration and a hallmark of dedication to me (army what!!). I hope you know how wise, well-spoken,
                    funny, and beautiful you are - you deserve to belong here, and I am SO incredibly happy to have been able to get to know your beautiful
                    soul through sessions. Anyway all love!  "God is with you" :)

                <p> I look up to you so much!! Ever since you first sent the email about yourself, I've been so impressed by how 
                    you've taken not only covid, but also other life challenges, in stride and have been so authentically you. 
                    You are so incredibly strong and fun to be around, and I've learned so much from our convos about 30A and just life. 
                    Suffice to say, I'm really happy to call you my friend (doggo + pet pics are a plus too haha).

                <p> The big brain herself!! I SO appreciate you attending basically every single PLF session,
                    even though you have been clearly killing it in LS30A (and other classes, even Ling lol) - but THANK YOU
                    for doing so otherwise and sticking with my cringiness lol (and really hope you apply to be one next year)!
                    I have no doubt you will only keep thriving in college and life (+find your mans!) :)

                <p> I mostly added this for aesthetic/symmetry purposes lol, but if you're reading this,
                    just know that I've been so incredibly humbled by the opportunity to "meet" y'all AND 
                    am taking your advice to recognize my own strengths. You have helped me on the journey to
                    self-confidence and self-love, something I am forever grateful for. :)
